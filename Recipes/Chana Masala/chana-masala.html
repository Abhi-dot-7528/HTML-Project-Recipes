      Chana masala is an Indian vegetarian stew featuring creamy chickpeas
      cooked in a fragrant and spicy tomato sauce anchored by a blend of spices
      called garam masala. It goes by many names, including chole masala (the
      name for the conventional chickpeas found in the U.S.), channay, and
      chholay. Chana masala is an Indian food staple and can be found in
      restaurants, street stalls, and home kitchens. On its own, this chickpea
      curry is gluten-free and can be vegan, but it’s often served alongside
      basmati rice, naan, or fluffy fry-breads like puri or bhatoora.

      <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2 tsp fresh grated ginger</li>
        <li>2 cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>2 tsp garam masala (a good quality curry powder will also do)</li>
        <li>½ tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tsp. amchoor powder</li>
        <li>½ tsp cayenne, or chili powder of choice, to taste</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes, diced, or 1 can diced/pureed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add
          the onion, and cook until translucent. Add the garlic, and continue to
          cook until onion is golden-brown and soft.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Add the chickpeas, ginger, garam masala, turmeric, amchoor, chili
          powder, tomatoes, and lemon juice. If you can’t find amchoor, don’t
          worry: while the dried green mango powder gives the final dish a more
          bright and tart character, lemon juice is a suitable and adequate
          substitute.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Lower heat, and bring to a simmer. Cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring
          frequently, until slightly thickened and chickpeas have begun to break
          down. If too thick, add a bit of water.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Remove from heat, and serve topped with cilantro if desired.</li>
        <br />
      </ol>
