        Palak paneer is a north Indian vegetarian curry with origins in the Punjab region. 
        The dish is comprised of a spinach purée (palak is Hindi for spinach) and 
        fresh-pressed cheese, with an aromatic blend of spices that includes ginger, 
        garlic, and garam masala. Palak paneer is also sometimes called saag paneer.

<!--=======================Steps===========================-->

    <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring salted water to a boil in a medium pot. Blanch the spinach leaves for 2 minutes, until leaves are bright green. Remove immediately and dunk in cold water; drain well. (You can also use frozen spinach; pop in the microwave in a bowl with a bit of water before using.)  
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Combine with tomato, ginger, the whole cloves of garlic, and chili in a food processor. Purée until a fine, wet paste forms. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Melt ghee in a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the chopped garlic, and sauté until beginning to brown, and then add the onions. Season with salt and pepper, and cook until translucent. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add the spinach mixture and water to the pan. Stir to combine, and season to taste. Lower stovetop to medium heat and cover, stirring occasionally, for about 6-8 minutes, or until thickened to preference. If it becomes too thick, adjust with more water. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            When you’ve achieved desired consistency, add garam masala, turmeric, cayenne, and coriander, and stir to combine. Season to taste. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Lower heat and add heavy cream and paneer. Simmer for a few minutes, until paneer is warmed through. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Remove from heat. Add lemon juice, fenugreek leaves, and stir to combine. Season with salt if desired. Serve hot with basmati rice or naan bread. 
        </li>
